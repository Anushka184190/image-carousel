# image-carousel
A web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a carousel of images that can be navigated by the user.

Here is a more detailed description:

The project would involve creating a HTML file that contains the markup for the carousel. The markup would include a div element that would contain the images, and an ordered list that would be used to control the navigation of the carousel. The CSS would be used to style the carousel, and the JavaScript would be used to control the interactions with the carousel.

The carousel could be used to display a variety of images, such as product images, portfolio images, or travel photos. The user could navigate the carousel by clicking on the arrows, or by swiping on the screen. The carousel could also be set to autoplay.
